2014-03-20 11:32 <samth> stamourv: what's the current status of the
                         benchmark library?
2014-03-20 11:40 <stamourv> Usable and documented.
2014-03-20 11:40 <stamourv> Interface may change some at some
                            point, but should be stable for the
                            foreseeable future.
2014-03-20 11:40 <samth> stamourv: awesome
2014-03-20 11:41 <stamourv> I'm still not 100% happy with the
                            statistics, but it's good enough that
                            I'm using it for my OOPSLA submission.
2014-03-20 11:41 <stamourv> It's not on the package catalog yet,
                            because the interface may still change.
2014-03-20 11:41 <samth> put it there with a version less than 1
2014-03-20 11:42 <samth> we agreed on this convention, i believe
2014-03-20 11:43 <samth> also, i just wrote a pull request for you
                         :)
2014-03-20 11:47 <samth> stamourv: and you're still opposed to
                         making `contract-benchmarks` into a
                         general benchmark suite?
2014-03-20 11:49 <stamourv> Re catalog: Maybe.
2014-03-20 11:49 <stamourv> Re pull request: what about?
2014-03-20 11:50 <stamourv> Re benchmarks: Hesitating. We need a
                            general benchmark suite, which should
                            include (some of) the contract
                            benchmarks, and others too.
2014-03-20 11:52 <samth> stamourv: re PR: fixing a link
2014-03-20 11:53 <samth> stamourv: my feeling about benchmark
                         suites is as follows
2014-03-20 11:53 <samth> we want a benchmark suite
2014-03-20 11:53 <samth> if we had one, we'd want to put a bunch of
                         stuff in it
2014-03-20 11:53 <samth> those benchmarks are already nicely
                         separated out and test substantial parts
                         of the code base
2014-03-20 11:54 <samth> so we'd want to add basically all of them
2014-03-20 11:59 <stamourv> Re nicely separated out: that's
                            unfortunately not completely
                            true. They're really tangled to our
                            infrastructure, and have weird
                            dependency patterns.
2014-03-20 12:00 <samth> stamourv: well, at least better separated
                         out than anything else we have, really
2014-03-20 12:00 <stamourv> Just yesterday, running the slideshow
                            benchmark managed to recompile part of
                            my install to link with the frozen
                            slideshow.
2014-03-20 12:00 <samth> weird
2014-03-20 12:00 <samth> what part of it did it depend on?
2014-03-20 12:00 <stamourv> I have to fix bitrot in them pretty
                            much every time I want to run them.
2014-03-20 12:00 <samth> b/c they depend on undocumented and
                         changing parts of libraries?
2014-03-20 12:01 <samth> or documented and shouldn't-be-but-are
                         changing parts?
2014-03-20 12:01 <stamourv> samth: I forget the exact problem, but
                            the pattern was that dependencies were
                            going out of the frozen collects, and
                            back in again.
2014-03-20 12:01 <stamourv> The latter.
2014-03-20 12:01 <samth> dammit
2014-03-20 12:01 <samth> we should stop doing that
2014-03-20 12:01 <stamourv> E.g. I had to fix the frozen TR
                            recently because it was using a part of
                            the contract system that disappeared.
2014-03-20 12:01 <stamourv> Scribble is a real pain for that too.
2014-03-20 12:02 <samth> i think TR uses some undocumented parts
2014-03-20 12:02 <samth> or did
2014-03-20 12:02 <stamourv> lazy, ode, plot and funky-town are
                            pretty much the only completely well
                            behaved ones.

2014-03-20 12:03 <stamourv> I've pretty much given up on using the

2014-03-20 12:03 <samth> we need to obey our own interfaces better

2014-03-20 12:09 <stamourv> Yes.
2014-03-20 12:10 <stamourv> Part of the problem, IMO, is that since
                            everything is in one big repo, changing
                            interfaces hurts less: you just change
                            all uses.
2014-03-20 12:10 <samth> if you have examples, it would be nice to
                         fix them
2014-03-20 12:10 <stamourv> Just look at the repo for commits that
                            mention "bitrot".
2014-03-20 12:10 <samth> yes, hopefully we can fix that by
                         splitting
2014-03-20 12:12 <samth> the TR bitrot looks like TR being bad
2014-03-20 12:14 <samth> and you gave up on keyboard?
2014-03-20 12:19 <stamourv> Yes. A bloody pain to set up and run.
2014-03-20 12:19 <stamourv> Needs a specific package installed (a
                            bit of a pain to do programmatically,
                            at leasy when I tried), which makes
                            DrRacket unusable.
2014-03-20 12:20 <stamourv> And takes over the machine while it
                            runs (like slideshow, but worse).

2014-03-20 13:45 <asumu> Except I doubt they are real

2014-03-20 13:45 <asumu> samth: "Hack treats traits as a
                         stand-alone entity during the type
                         checking process. In other words, it
                         ensures type consistency within the trait
                         (i.e., as a black box, so to speak), but
                         does not "copy and paste" the code into
                         all of the classes that use the trait and
                         check for type consistency there. The
                         reason this is done comes down to
                         performance."
2014-03-20 13:45 <asumu> Interesting, they basically punt on
                         checking class composition.
2014-03-20 13:47 <asumu> Maybe I need a related work section on

                         trait.
2014-03-20 20:12 <asumu> i.e., the trait "application"
2014-03-20 20:12 <asumu> Unless these trait requirements are

2014-03-20 20:13 <asumu> I should try to make a counterexample

2014-03-20 20:21 <asumu> It seems like it should be, but I could be
                         misunderstanding.
2014-03-20 20:22 <asumu> Oh, you have to annotate the abstract
                         method too.
2014-03-20 20:23 <samth> adding types everywhere seems to show a
                         type error for me
2014-03-20 20:24 <asumu> Yeah, it does appear to be ok if you add
                         type annotations everywhere.
2014-03-20 20:24 <asumu> So if you don't add type annotations,
                         there are no guarantees?
2014-03-20 20:24 <asumu> (not even a cast presumably?)
2014-03-20 20:25 <samth> there are some runtime checks, but i don't
                         really understand what they do
2014-03-20 20:25 <samth> but they're not full gradual typing
2014-03-20 20:25 <samth> i think //strict is supposed to force full
                         annotation
2014-03-20 20:25 <samth> but it doesn't seem to
2014-03-20 20:28 <samth> http://docs.hhvm.com/manual/en/hack.modes.strict.php
2014-03-20 20:28 <samth> maybe you need to install it to really

2014-03-20 22:04 <samth> the latter is unlikely since marketplace

2014-03-20 22:41 <asumu> I am surprised, since this means the
                         overhead is in just doing the
                         strongly-connected-components algorithm,
                         which is linear in the number of type

                         docker.io do not appear to actually work
                         anymore)

2014-03-22 15:40 <asumu> tonyg: is it accurate to say that
                         Smalltalk uses keyword-based class
                         constructors? (I guess they are actually
                         called selectors in ST parlance?)
2014-03-22 17:05 <ianjneu> *sigh* how do I make stuff span multiple
                           columns in an align* environment again?
                           Everything's coming up Milhouse.
2014-03-22 17:05 <ianjneu> I mean tabular.
2014-03-22 17:09 <stamourv> Dunno if you can do that in
                            tabular. Maybe in booktabs?

2014-03-24 18:00 <bennn> I need to typeset some inference rules for
                         a midterm. Should I use redex?
2014-03-24 18:01 <tonyg> bennn: \usepackage{bussproofs}
2014-03-24 18:01 <bennn> (or scribble, or stick with LaTeX)
2014-03-24 18:01 <samth> bennn: i wouldn't use redex unless i
                         already had a redex model
2014-03-24 18:02 <bennn> the rules are extensions for imp
2014-03-24 18:02 <bennn> I'm not sure what a redex model is, but I
                         think I could make one for this case
2014-03-24 18:03 <bennn> tonyg: any reason to use bussproofs over
                         mathpartir or semantic?
2014-03-24 18:04 <samth> bennn: if you're not sure what a redex
                         model is, and you already know some latex
                         system, then stick with what you know
2014-03-24 18:04 <bennn> samth: the midterm question is easy. I
                         wanted to learn something new.
2014-03-24 18:04 <tonyg> bennn: ooo, i haven't evaluated those. i
                         have only used bussproofs in the past
2014-03-24 18:05 <samth> ah, then learn redex by all means :)
2014-03-24 18:05 <tonyg> mathpartir looks nice
2014-03-24 18:07 <bennn> samth: ok, cool
2014-03-24 18:09 <samth> tonyg: mathpartir is what i usually use
2014-03-24 18:11 <stamourv> Same here.
2014-03-24 18:11 <stamourv> Says the guy who had to typeset about 5
                            inference rules in the last 3 years.
2014-03-24 18:15 <bennn> Nate Foster uses mathpartir
2014-03-24 18:15 <samth> bennn: and nate is a smart guy
2014-03-24 18:15 <bennn> he's my typesetting idol
2014-03-24 18:17 <samth> bennn: that had to go on twitter
